            <p>As part of the Eye melanoma research conducted by GeneCoop Principal Investigator I have agreed to the following permissions:
            <ul>
                <li>Erasmus MC will access my Saliva for an Array Test.</li>
                <li>
                    Erasmus MC will store a Raw DNA data file on SURF LabSafe.
                    <pre>
Given I am 'SURF LabSafe'
Given that I have a 'public key' from 'Erasmus MC'
Given that I have a 'string dictionary' named 'permission_request'
Given that I have a 'string' named 'operation'
Given that I have a 'string' named 'consent_key'
Given that I have a 'string' named 'research'
Given that I have a 'string' named 'data_class'
Given that I have a 'signature' named 'permission_request.signature'
When 'operation' is found in 'permission_request'
When I verify the 'operation' is equal to 'store'
When 'research' is found in 'permission_request'

When I verify the 'data_class' is equal to 'Raw DNA data file'
When 'signature' is found in 'permission_request'
When I verify the 'permission_request' has a signature in 'permission_request.signature' by 'ErasmusMC'
Then print 'operation allowed'
                   </pre>
