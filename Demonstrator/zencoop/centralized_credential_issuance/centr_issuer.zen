Scenario 'credential': centralized issuer
Given that I am known as 'Issuer'
When I create the issuer keypair
and I create the credential keypair
and I create the credential request
and I create the credential signature
and I create the credentials
Then print the 'credentials'
and print the 'credential keypair'
and print my 'verifier' from 'issuer keypair'
