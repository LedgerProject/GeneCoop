Scenario 'ecdh': verify the signature of a request

# Loading data
Given I have a 'public key' from 'Signer' 
and I have a 'string' named 'message' 
and I have a 'signature' named 'signature'

When I create the hash of 'message' using 'sha512'
and I verify the 'hash' has a signature in 'signature' by 'Signer'

# Here we're printing the original message along with happy statement of success
Then print the string 'verification passed'
